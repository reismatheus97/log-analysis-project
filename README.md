# log-analysis-project
The third project into the Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree. \
This isn't a commercial project and has only academic purposes.

# Requirements
Python 2 or 3.

# Running the project
According to the project's specification, only the python file needs to be submitted. \
I assumed that the project would be executed inside a virtual machine, managed by Vagrant and a ```Vagrantfile``` identical to that showed in the course.

Considering this:

1- Clone the repo to a folder: \
```$ git clone https://github.com/reismatheus97/log-analysis-project.git``` 

2- Get into the project's folder: \
```$ cd log-analysis-project``` 

3- Copy ```log-analysis-project.py``` and paste it into the vagrant directory inside your virtual machine.

4- Connect to your VM and get into the vagrant directory \
```$ cd / & cd /vagrant ``` 

5- Then, run: \
```$ python log-analysis-project.py ```
